# 2D Bird Robots Project Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the basic architecture for the 2D bird robots project. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and functionalities.

## Modules

### 1. Environment
The environment module defines the reinforcement learning environment for the bird robots. This includes the state representation, action space, reward structure, and environment dynamics.

**File:** `environment.py`

### 2. Training
The training module handles the training process for the reinforcement learning agent. This includes setting up the training loop, defining the agent, and saving the trained policy.

**File:** `train_agent.py`

### 3. Testing
The testing module is responsible for evaluating the performance of the trained reinforcement learning agent. This includes running multiple episodes and reporting the results.

**File:** `test_agent.py`

### 4. Configuration
The configuration module defines various parameters and constants used throughout the project. This includes environment settings, training parameters, and directory paths.

**File:** `config.py`

## Future Extensions
The architecture is designed to be flexible and can be extended with additional modules as needed. Potential future extensions include:
- Communication: Handling communication between multiple bird robots or with a central control system.
- User Interface: Providing a graphical interface for monitoring and controlling the bird robots.
- Machine Learning: Integrating machine learning algorithms for advanced decision-making and behavior prediction.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a starting point for the development of the 2D bird robots project. It can be adjusted and expanded based on the specific requirements and feedback from the user.
