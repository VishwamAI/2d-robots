# Plan for Implementing Exercises and Human-like Practices

## Overview
The goal is to enhance the existing 2D walking model to perform exercises and human-like practices using reinforcement learning. This involves designing new behaviors, environments, reward functions, and updating the reinforcement learning agent to handle these tasks.

## Steps

### 1. Define New Behaviors
- Identify specific exercises and human-like practices for the robot to learn.
- Examples: squats, lunges, jumping jacks, walking in different patterns, etc.

### 2. Design or Select Environments
- Create or adapt environments where these behaviors can be simulated.
- Ensure the environments provide the necessary features for the robot to perform the exercises.

### 3. Develop Reward Functions
- Design reward functions that encourage the robot to learn the new behaviors.
- Consider factors such as correct posture, smoothness of movement, and completion of the exercise.

### 4. Extend Action and Observation Spaces
- Modify the action and observation spaces if necessary to accommodate the new behaviors.
- Ensure the agent has the required inputs and outputs to perform the exercises.

### 5. Update Reinforcement Learning Agent
- Adapt the neural network architecture or learning algorithm to handle the new tasks.
- Consider using advanced techniques such as curriculum learning to gradually introduce more complex behaviors.

### 6. Train and Evaluate the Agent
- Train the agent on the new tasks using the updated environments and reward functions.
- Evaluate the agent's performance and make adjustments as needed.

## Implementation Details

### Example Behavior: Squats
- **Environment**: Flat surface with markers for correct squat depth.
- **Reward Function**: Positive reward for maintaining correct posture, reaching the desired squat depth, and returning to the starting position.
- **Action Space**: Joint angles for legs and torso.
- **Observation Space**: Joint angles, velocities, and positions of markers.

### Example Behavior: Jumping Jacks
- **Environment**: Flat surface with markers for arm and leg positions.
- **Reward Function**: Positive reward for synchronizing arm and leg movements, reaching the desired positions, and maintaining balance.
- **Action Space**: Joint angles for arms and legs.
- **Observation Space**: Joint angles, velocities, and positions of markers.

## Next Steps
- Implement the example behaviors (squats and jumping jacks) in the codebase.
- Test the new behaviors and refine the reward functions and environments as needed.
- Expand the set of exercises and human-like practices based on initial results.
