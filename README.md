# 2D Bird Robots Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a 2D simulation of bird robots. The simulation will include various functionalities such as movement, control, and sensor integration. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and functionalities.

## Project Structure
- `movement.py`: Contains the movement algorithms for the bird robots.
- `control.py`: Handles the overall control logic for the bird robots.
- `sensors.py`: Integrates and processes data from various sensors.
- `config.py`: Defines configuration parameters for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Provides an overview of the project architecture.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAirobotics/2D-birds.git
   cd 2D-birds
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project (placeholder for actual run instructions):
   ```bash
   # Add instructions to run the project here
   ```
