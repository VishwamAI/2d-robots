# 2D Bird Robots Project Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the basic architecture for the 2D bird robots project. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and functionalities.

## Modules

### 1. Movement
The movement module is responsible for controlling the movement of the bird robots. This includes algorithms for pathfinding, obstacle avoidance, and other movement-related functionalities.

**File:** `movement.py`

### 2. Control
The control module handles the overall control logic for the bird robots. This includes state management, decision-making processes, and coordination between different modules.

**File:** `control.py`

### 3. Sensors
The sensors module is responsible for integrating and processing data from various sensors. This includes data acquisition, filtering, and interpretation to provide meaningful information to other modules.

**File:** `sensors.py`

## Future Extensions
The architecture is designed to be flexible and can be extended with additional modules as needed. Potential future extensions include:
- Communication: Handling communication between multiple bird robots or with a central control system.
- User Interface: Providing a graphical interface for monitoring and controlling the bird robots.
- Machine Learning: Integrating machine learning algorithms for advanced decision-making and behavior prediction.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a starting point for the development of the 2D bird robots project. It can be adjusted and expanded based on the specific requirements and feedback from the user.
